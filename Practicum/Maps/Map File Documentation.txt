Maps must start with the width of the map, followed by the height of the map.

Valid map tiles are

'c' - City
'f' - Factory
'r' - road
'g' - grass
'h' - Hill
'm' - Mountain
's' - Swamp

City and Factory tiles may have a default owner, which can be signified by a player id number written directly after. -1 may be used to signify the tile is unowned.
e.g. c1 (City tile owned by player 1)

The map must have at least 2 players.

To specify a unit on a tile, add the character 'u', directly followed by the unit type unique character identifier and the side number.
e.g. c1ui1 (City tile owned by player 1 with a unit type specified by 'i' owned by player 1.
